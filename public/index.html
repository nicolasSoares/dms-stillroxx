+ How it's work ?
<br/>
Just register an account (no personnal data is required). 
An email (it's not even necessary) and a password (complexe and random please !)
When you miss a RDV you have i+24H (Protection if you're drunk lol) to 'push' the button, 
And if you don't push the button we launch the action (Sending email for now, later we will add other action).
Once the action launch, the account is deleted (The username will not be available again).
